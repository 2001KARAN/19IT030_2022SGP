  1.1 PROJECT OVERVIEW: 

Scout Suite is a multi-cloud configuration review tool, which enables assessing the security posture of cloud environments. Using the APIs exposed by cloud providers, Scout gathers configuration data for manual inspection and highlights risk areas . Rather than pouring through dozens of pages on the web, Scout supplies a clear view of the attack surface automatically.

Scout Suite is stable and actively maintained, but a number of features and internals may change. As such, please bear with us as we find time to work on, and improve, the tool. Feel free to report a bug with details (please provide console output using the "--debug" argument), request a new feature, or send a pull request.


1.2 OBJECTIVE:

The main objective to make this project of cloud based project is to the learn and implement the basic to advanced knowledge concepts of AWS services like EC2, VPC, subnets, Elastic load balancers and networking concepts that have been known to us or have been learned by us. further more another goal apart from the learning that has been setup by us at the ScoutSuite auditing tool is to generate a HTML report of all services of a aws account used by user automatically just by adding users credentials. And most importantly  just by adding the public IP of the user all can have a look at that report and have  one can have a better understanding about which services are being used and which of the services are running without any use of them.


1.3 Tools And Technologies:

When the idea of making a Cloud based security auditing tool came to our mind, the first thing that was required to be done was to gather the information of the things that were required to be learnt by us in order to make this project come to life. Hence after some brain storming and group discussions we followed the following figure and according to that learned the things in order.

 

After the conduction of this brainstorming and learning the process the tools and technologies that we had to use were as follows:

·       EC2

·       VPC

·       Nginx

·       Python

·       ScoutSuite

·       Stackoverflow (to learn for our software requirements)

·       GitHub (to learn about our topics)

 

IDE’s :
